# Generic NLP Project: TweetsGenerator

This project focuses on converting an NLP-based project called “TweetsGenerator,” which is built on a Markov chain data structure, into a generic programming format.
The goal is to generalize the mechanism so that it can be used with various data types, expanding its application beyond just a tweet generator.

## Overview

After converting the original TweetsGenerator into a generic program, the project is applied to two main use cases:
1.	#### Twitter Tweet Generator:
	A tool that generates Twitter tweets based on Markov chains, mimicking the style and context of the input data.
2. #### Snakes and Ladders Game:
   A game implementation that utilizes the Markov chain mechanism to assess probabilities and enhance the gameplay experience, making the game more dynamic and engaging.
